# Deep Sea of Mind

This playground is a journey of a diver exploring the deep sea. However, it also relates this exploration of the deep sea to the exploration of one's own mind in a process of self-knowledge and self-discovery. To achieve this, I took inspiration from some games like Celeste and Omori, which each in their way relate the game to mental health. At first, I only had the idea to submit a game, but I also wanted the idea to be something that I could relate to, something memorable for me and others that delivers a positive message in a memorable way. Then, this idea emerged from my experience with these games and by incorporating some of my own experiences and some knowledge from studies that I read.
